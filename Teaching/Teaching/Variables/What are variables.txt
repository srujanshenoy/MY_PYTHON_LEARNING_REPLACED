What are variables?

Think of variables like boxes. The label of the box is the variable nam and the content inside the box would be the thing linked to that name. For example,

		|------|
Box X = |   1  |
		|------|

Think of it like the above box. Box X is the label of the box contaning the number 1.

In python code, the above diagram would be represented with:-

X = 1

This code if it was run would store the number 1 in the variable X

There are diffrent types of variables. Let us learn about them.
