# Variables are things that you can define the value of
# You can think of their names as a label for a box.
# there are a few types in variables, the basics being strings, integers, and booleans.
# Strings are just a few characters together. They are represented with "" or ''
# Lets take an example to store Hello world in a variable.
Text = "Hello World"
# Here, the variable name is Text and note that python is CASE SENSITIVE
# Meaning that Text is not equal to text.
# We can also see that there is concatenated "Hello World" in it

# Let's run the program -- if you're left wondering why it did not write anything,
# It's because we just stored it. We did not tell it to Print anything.
# To print, let us learn it next.
